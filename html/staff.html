                                mentorship of Professor Chen Hui, a leading authority on early Chinese dynasties. His core skills include
                                stratigraphic excavation, digital mapping, and artifact cataloging. At the East Asian History Museum, Dr.
                                Zhang leads the recovery and analysis of ancient objects for the museum&rsquo;s joint project, working closely

        </strong>
        Lead Interpreter &ndash; East Asian Ritual &amp; Narrative. Oversees public interpretation for

         Bio:
        </strong>
        Ph.D. in Comparative Mythology (Kyoto University); M.A. in Conservation Science (Tokyo
    University of the Arts); postdoctoral research on temple inventories

  practice. He also maintains a working reference corpus (e.g., luopan/bi compasses, Goryeo ritual vessels, talchum
